ABSTRACT="The problem of human activity recognition from mobile sensor data can be
applied to multiple domains such as health monitoring, personal fitness,
daily lifelogging, and senior care. A critical challenge for training human
activity recognition models is the data. Acquiring a balanced dataset
containing accurate activity labels require humans to correctly annotate
and potentially interfere with the subjects' normal activities in
real-time. Nonetheless, there is often an inherent and implicit chronology
to human behavior for example we take a shower after we exercise. This
implicit chronology can be used to learn missing labels and classify future
activities. In this work, we propose HAR-GCCN, a deep graph CNN model that
leverages the correlation between chronologically adjacent sensor
measurements to predict the correct labels for unclassified activities with
at least one activity label is precisely known. We propose a special
training strategy that enforces the model to predict the missing activities
labels by leveraging known ones. HAR-GCCN shows superior performance
relative to previously used baseline methods, improving classification
accuracy by about 25\% and up to 68\% on different datasets."
